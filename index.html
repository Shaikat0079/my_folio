            <h3>Web Developer, App Developer, Tech Enthusiast, Bike & Car Freak!</h3>
            <p>Currently I am not doing anything except focusing on web developing. By taking the course of Programming
                Hero. I
                have completed the last 4 modules without any burden and hassle. The course seems to be pretty fun and
                skillful.
                I also completed a course upon app development with <span>Flutter</span> which was a Government course.
                I was
                doing well at the begining of the course but in the end I was not able to co-operate with the and lag
                behind.
                But I am hopeful with this course and I will do my best in this one.

            <p>I have already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my
